/*
Package ocstructs is a generated package which contains definitions
of structs which represent a YANG schema. The generated schema can be
compressed by a series of transformations (compression was false
in this case).

This package was generated by codegen-tests
using the following YANG input files:
	- ../testdata/modules/openconfig-import.yang
Imported modules were sourced from:

// Binary is a type that is used for fields that have a YANG type of
// binary. It is used such that binary fields can be distinguished from
// leaf-lists of uint8s (which are mapped to []uint8, equivalent to
// []byte in reflection).
type Binary []byte

// YANGEmpty is a type that is used for fields that have a YANG type of
// empty. It is used such that empty fields can be distinguished from boolean fields
// in the generated code.
type YANGEmpty bool

// OpenconfigImport_Child represents the /openconfig-import/child YANG schema element.

// interface. This allows functions that need to handle this struct to
// identify it as being generated by ygen.
